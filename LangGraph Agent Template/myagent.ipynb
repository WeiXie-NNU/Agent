The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 326, 'prompt_tokens': 6146, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFOCRKQ4isZYdgPPc2hyFqvmqc9', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--4a9951bb-9b6c-4adf-9d56-f74def63e809-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6146, 'output_tokens': 326, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='44632768-1090-40bc-a7f0-45663ca1e5ef'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's correct!

One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face.

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models. Coastal cities, like Alexandria, are also facing same problem. It is said that every\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485524004249\"/>\\nCoastal areas in Egypt are under pressure and threat due to natural impacts, such as wave, current, tide, storm surges, and sediment supply as well as human interventions in the form of construction of seawalls, breakwaters, groins, and jetties as well as tourism development (ElKotby et al.,2023). Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses. Climate change is known to increase the frequency and severity of heatwaves, and to make precipitation less predictable a\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports.

This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020). As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023).

The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role.

Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports.

Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

Concerned about conservation and its implications for local communities and ecosystems.'), 'interview': \"Human: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Hello, Dr. Rashid! My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid. It's surprising to hear that not only are we seeing rising sea levels, but also this phenomenon of land sinking creating compounded effects in such a densely populated area. \\n\\nCould you elaborate more on the cultural implications of these flooding events for the communities living in the Nile Delta? For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's correct! I'm delving into the complex interplay between the environmental changes occurring in the Nile Delta and their far-reaching impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how cultural practices, traditional livelihoods, and identity are adapting—or struggling to adapt—to the ongoing flooding and its causes. \\n\\nI'm intrigued by how this environmental crisis can disrupt not just the physical landscape, but the very fabric of community life. I would love to delve deeper into the role of local governance and community engagement in addressing these challenges. How are local communities responding to the flood risks? Are there any community-led initiatives or government policies that aim to mitigate the impacts? Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's right! I'm exploring the causes and consequences of the Nile Delta flooding in 2023, focusing on the environmental and cultural impacts on local communities. I'm particularly interested in how these floods are reshaping traditions, livelihoods, and identities in the region.\\n\\nBefore we wrap up, could you share a specific case study or personal story from your research that illustrates the human experience of flooding in the Nile Delta? Perhaps an individual or community that has been profoundly impacted by these events? This could provide a compelling narrative for my article.\\nAI: Yes, absolutely! One poignant case is that of a farmer named Saeed Umaira from Kafr El-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. His family has been cultivating crops in the region for generations. However, in recent years, the increasing salinity of the soil has dramatically affected his land's productivity. The saltwater intrusion due to rising sea levels has resulted in more than 80% of his farmland becoming unviable for traditional crops such as rice and vegetables [1].\\n\\nSaeed recounts how his family has adapted by shifting to more salt-tolerant crops, but the yields are significantly lower compared to what they once harvested. This economic strain has not only challenged his family's livelihood but has also disrupted the cultural practices around farming that have been a source of pride for his community. \\n\\nMoreover, he describes the emotional toll of witnessing the decline of his ancestral land, which is intertwined with his family's identity and heritage. The community's traditional agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest have become less frequent as the challenges surrounding food production intensify [2]. \\n\\nSaeed's story highlights the broader narrative of resilience and adaptation among local communities facing the ramifications of climate change and flooding. It underscores the necessity for holistic responses that incorporate local knowledge and practices into broader climate policies that affect their lives and traditions.\\n\\nSuch personal accounts offer a deeper understanding of how environmental changes affect people on an individual level, showcasing the pressing need for sustainable solutions within community contexts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] Earth Journalism Network article \\n[2] Climate Centre report\\nAI: Thank you so much for sharing that powerful story, Dr. Rashid.

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted.

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 326, 'prompt_tokens': 6146, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFOCRKQ4isZYdgPPc2hyFqvmqc9', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--4a9951bb-9b6c-4adf-9d56-f74def63e809-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6146, 'output_tokens': 326, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='44632768-1090-40bc-a7f0-45663ca1e5ef'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's correct!

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 326, 'prompt_tokens': 6146, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFOCRKQ4isZYdgPPc2hyFqvmqc9', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--4a9951bb-9b6c-4adf-9d56-f74def63e809-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6146, 'output_tokens': 326, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='44632768-1090-40bc-a7f0-45663ca1e5ef'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's correct!

This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 308, 'prompt_tokens': 9115, 'total_tokens': 9423, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 5248}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFsn6puewdlVdGJYdZLHWjx6kHj', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--a5699970-dd64-466e-ad40-c3d076126fdd-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 9115, 'output_tokens': 308, 'total_tokens': 9423, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 5248}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5016b844-c041-4d5c-ab00-0c2c457f8b7b'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's right!

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models. Coastal cities, like Alexandria, are also facing same problem.

Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places.

This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020). As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8\"/>\\nexample, under the CCSM4 model, the peak flow for the first event (1998–2003) increased from 7002 m 3/s in 1998 to 8600 m 3/s (RCP 4.5) and 9400 m 3/s (RCP 8.5) in 2003 (Fig.[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8#Fig6)a,b, and Supplementary Fig.[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8#MOESM1)b).

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region.

For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

I'm delving into the complex interplay between the environmental changes occurring in the Nile Delta and their far-reaching impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how cultural practices, traditional livelihoods, and identity are adapting—or struggling to adapt—to the ongoing flooding and its causes. \\n\\nI'm intrigued by how this environmental crisis can disrupt not just the physical landscape, but the very fabric of community life. I would love to delve deeper into the role of local governance and community engagement in addressing these challenges. How are local communities responding to the flood risks? Are there any community-led initiatives or government policies that aim to mitigate the impacts? Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's right!

I'm particularly interested in how these floods are reshaping traditions, livelihoods, and identities in the region.\\n\\nBefore we wrap up, could you share a specific case study or personal story from your research that illustrates the human experience of flooding in the Nile Delta? Perhaps an individual or community that has been profoundly impacted by these events? This could provide a compelling narrative for my article.\\nAI: Yes, absolutely! One poignant case is that of a farmer named Saeed Umaira from Kafr El-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. His family has been cultivating crops in the region for generations. However, in recent years, the increasing salinity of the soil has dramatically affected his land's productivity. The saltwater intrusion due to rising sea levels has resulted in more than 80% of his farmland becoming unviable for traditional crops such as rice and vegetables [1].\\n\\nSaeed recounts how his family has adapted by shifting to more salt-tolerant crops, but the yields are significantly lower compared to what they once harvested. This economic strain has not only challenged his family's livelihood but has also disrupted the cultural practices around farming that have been a source of pride for his community. \\n\\nMoreover, he describes the emotional toll of witnessing the decline of his ancestral land, which is intertwined with his family's identity and heritage. The community's traditional agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest have become less frequent as the challenges surrounding food production intensify [2]. \\n\\nSaeed's story highlights the broader narrative of resilience and adaptation among local communities facing the ramifications of climate change and flooding. It underscores the necessity for holistic responses that incorporate local knowledge and practices into broader climate policies that affect their lives and traditions.\\n\\nSuch personal accounts offer a deeper understanding of how environmental changes affect people on an individual level, showcasing the pressing need for sustainable solutions within community contexts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] Earth Journalism Network article \\n[2] Climate Centre report\\nAI: Thank you so much for sharing that powerful story, Dr. Rashid.

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'run_id': '95a79947-2cc7-459a-aef6-6d1e21a336c9', 'name': 'ask_question', 'tags': ['graph:step:60'], 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 60, 'langgraph_node': 'ask_question', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:ask_question',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'ask_question'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'ask_question:64558260-1031-e547-5fa1-f18f67e89521'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78']}\n",

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models.

Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses. Climate change is known to increase the frequency and severity of heatwaves, and to make precipitation less predictable a\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places.

The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role.

Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

Concerned about conservation and its implications for local communities and ecosystems.'), 'interview': \"Human: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Hello, Dr. Rashid! My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid. It's surprising to hear that not only are we seeing rising sea levels, but also this phenomenon of land sinking creating compounded effects in such a densely populated area. \\n\\nCould you elaborate more on the cultural implications of these flooding events for the communities living in the Nile Delta? For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's correct! I'm delving into the complex interplay between the environmental changes occurring in the Nile Delta and their far-reaching impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how cultural practices, traditional livelihoods, and identity are adapting—or struggling to adapt—to the ongoing flooding and its causes. \\n\\nI'm intrigued by how this environmental crisis can disrupt not just the physical landscape, but the very fabric of community life. I would love to delve deeper into the role of local governance and community engagement in addressing these challenges. How are local communities responding to the flood risks? Are there any community-led initiatives or government policies that aim to mitigate the impacts? Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face.

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'name': 'search_web', 'tags': ['graph:step:61'], 'run_id': 'ac7e876a-91e2-4e97-9a14-90096474a8c5', 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 61, 'langgraph_node': 'search_web', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:search_web',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'search_web'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'search_web:11c093ea-6732-85b4-fa68-589b789a13ca'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78']}\n",

The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models.

Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places.

This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020). As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8\"/>\\nexample, under the CCSM4 model, the peak flow for the first event (1998–2003) increased from 7002 m 3/s in 1998 to 8600 m 3/s (RCP 4.5) and 9400 m 3/s (RCP 8.5) in 2003 (Fig.[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8#Fig6)a,b, and Supplementary Fig.[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8#MOESM1)b).

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role.

Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1].

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

I'm delving into the complex interplay between the environmental changes occurring in the Nile Delta and their far-reaching impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how cultural practices, traditional livelihoods, and identity are adapting—or struggling to adapt—to the ongoing flooding and its causes. \\n\\nI'm intrigued by how this environmental crisis can disrupt not just the physical landscape, but the very fabric of community life. I would love to delve deeper into the role of local governance and community engagement in addressing these challenges. How are local communities responding to the flood risks? Are there any community-led initiatives or government policies that aim to mitigate the impacts? Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's right!

Perhaps an individual or community that has been profoundly impacted by these events? This could provide a compelling narrative for my article.\\nAI: Yes, absolutely! One poignant case is that of a farmer named Saeed Umaira from Kafr El-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. His family has been cultivating crops in the region for generations. However, in recent years, the increasing salinity of the soil has dramatically affected his land's productivity. The saltwater intrusion due to rising sea levels has resulted in more than 80% of his farmland becoming unviable for traditional crops such as rice and vegetables [1].\\n\\nSaeed recounts how his family has adapted by shifting to more salt-tolerant crops, but the yields are significantly lower compared to what they once harvested. This economic strain has not only challenged his family's livelihood but has also disrupted the cultural practices around farming that have been a source of pride for his community. \\n\\nMoreover, he describes the emotional toll of witnessing the decline of his ancestral land, which is intertwined with his family's identity and heritage. The community's traditional agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest have become less frequent as the challenges surrounding food production intensify [2]. \\n\\nSaeed's story highlights the broader narrative of resilience and adaptation among local communities facing the ramifications of climate change and flooding. It underscores the necessity for holistic responses that incorporate local knowledge and practices into broader climate policies that affect their lives and traditions.\\n\\nSuch personal accounts offer a deeper understanding of how environmental changes affect people on an individual level, showcasing the pressing need for sustainable solutions within community contexts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] Earth Journalism Network article \\n[2] Climate Centre report\\nAI: Thank you so much for sharing that powerful story, Dr. Rashid.

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'name': 'search_wikipedia', 'tags': ['graph:step:61'], 'run_id': '1d8ea3f6-121c-4b67-9392-3001b4871db9', 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 61, 'langgraph_node': 'search_wikipedia', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:search_wikipedia',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'search_wikipedia'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'search_wikipedia:91fad88f-acce-616d-b7bb-e2e638097261'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78']}\n",

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 308, 'prompt_tokens': 9115, 'total_tokens': 9423, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 5248}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFsn6puewdlVdGJYdZLHWjx6kHj', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--a5699970-dd64-466e-ad40-c3d076126fdd-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 9115, 'output_tokens': 308, 'total_tokens': 9423, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 5248}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5016b844-c041-4d5c-ab00-0c2c457f8b7b'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's right!

One poignant case is that of a farmer named Saeed Umaira from Kafr El-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. His family has been cultivating crops in the region for generations. However, in recent years, the increasing salinity of the soil has dramatically affected his land's productivity. The saltwater intrusion due to rising sea levels has resulted in more than 80% of his farmland becoming unviable for traditional crops such as rice and vegetables [1].\\n\\nSaeed recounts how his family has adapted by shifting to more salt-tolerant crops, but the yields are significantly lower compared to what they once harvested. This economic strain has not only challenged his family's livelihood but has also disrupted the cultural practices around farming that have been a source of pride for his community. \\n\\nMoreover, he describes the emotional toll of witnessing the decline of his ancestral land, which is intertwined with his family's identity and heritage. The community's traditional agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest have become less frequent as the challenges surrounding food production intensify [2]. \\n\\nSaeed's story highlights the broader narrative of resilience and adaptation among local communities facing the ramifications of climate change and flooding. It underscores the necessity for holistic responses that incorporate local knowledge and practices into broader climate policies that affect their lives and traditions.\\n\\nSuch personal accounts offer a deeper understanding of how environmental changes affect people on an individual level, showcasing the pressing need for sustainable solutions within community contexts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] Earth Journalism Network article \\n[2] Climate Centre report\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 308, 'prompt_tokens': 12145, 'total_tokens': 12453, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloHYYybzyhDSV51SVvW5HwnrSNdI', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--1651710a-ce87-4413-83ef-a06efb468f74-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12145, 'output_tokens': 308, 'total_tokens': 12453, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content='Thank you so much for sharing that powerful story, Dr. Rashid.

One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 326, 'prompt_tokens': 6146, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFOCRKQ4isZYdgPPc2hyFqvmqc9', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--4a9951bb-9b6c-4adf-9d56-f74def63e809-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6146, 'output_tokens': 326, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='44632768-1090-40bc-a7f0-45663ca1e5ef'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's correct!

This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 308, 'prompt_tokens': 9115, 'total_tokens': 9423, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 5248}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFsn6puewdlVdGJYdZLHWjx6kHj', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--a5699970-dd64-466e-ad40-c3d076126fdd-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 9115, 'output_tokens': 308, 'total_tokens': 9423, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 5248}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5016b844-c041-4d5c-ab00-0c2c457f8b7b'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's right!

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models. Coastal cities, like Alexandria, are also facing same problem. It is said that every\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485524004249\"/>\\nCoastal areas in Egypt are under pressure and threat due to natural impacts, such as wave, current, tide, storm surges, and sediment supply as well as human interventions in the form of construction of seawalls, breakwaters, groins, and jetties as well as tourism development (ElKotby et al.,2023). Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places.

This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020). As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes. Many unresolved questions concerning the AHP remain: its beginning, cause, in\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe sea level has been rising from the end of the last ice age, which was around 20,000 years ago. Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

Concerned about conservation and its implications for local communities and ecosystems.'), 'interview': \"Human: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Hello, Dr. Rashid! My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid. It's surprising to hear that not only are we seeing rising sea levels, but also this phenomenon of land sinking creating compounded effects in such a densely populated area. \\n\\nCould you elaborate more on the cultural implications of these flooding events for the communities living in the Nile Delta? For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's correct! I'm delving into the complex interplay between the environmental changes occurring in the Nile Delta and their far-reaching impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how cultural practices, traditional livelihoods, and identity are adapting—or struggling to adapt—to the ongoing flooding and its causes. \\n\\nI'm intrigued by how this environmental crisis can disrupt not just the physical landscape, but the very fabric of community life. I would love to delve deeper into the role of local governance and community engagement in addressing these challenges. How are local communities responding to the flood risks? Are there any community-led initiatives or government policies that aim to mitigate the impacts? Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's right! I'm exploring the causes and consequences of the Nile Delta flooding in 2023, focusing on the environmental and cultural impacts on local communities. I'm particularly interested in how these floods are reshaping traditions, livelihoods, and identities in the region.\\n\\nBefore we wrap up, could you share a specific case study or personal story from your research that illustrates the human experience of flooding in the Nile Delta? Perhaps an individual or community that has been profoundly impacted by these events? This could provide a compelling narrative for my article.\\nAI: Yes, absolutely! One poignant case is that of a farmer named Saeed Umaira from Kafr El-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. His family has been cultivating crops in the region for generations. However, in recent years, the increasing salinity of the soil has dramatically affected his land's productivity. The saltwater intrusion due to rising sea levels has resulted in more than 80% of his farmland becoming unviable for traditional crops such as rice and vegetables [1].\\n\\nSaeed recounts how his family has adapted by shifting to more salt-tolerant crops, but the yields are significantly lower compared to what they once harvested. This economic strain has not only challenged his family's livelihood but has also disrupted the cultural practices around farming that have been a source of pride for his community. \\n\\nMoreover, he describes the emotional toll of witnessing the decline of his ancestral land, which is intertwined with his family's identity and heritage. The community's traditional agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest have become less frequent as the challenges surrounding food production intensify [2]. \\n\\nSaeed's story highlights the broader narrative of resilience and adaptation among local communities facing the ramifications of climate change and flooding. It underscores the necessity for holistic responses that incorporate local knowledge and practices into broader climate policies that affect their lives and traditions.\\n\\nSuch personal accounts offer a deeper understanding of how environmental changes affect people on an individual level, showcasing the pressing need for sustainable solutions within community contexts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] Earth Journalism Network article \\n[2] Climate Centre report\\nAI: Thank you so much for sharing that powerful story, Dr. Rashid. It certainly highlights the deep, personal connections individuals have with their land and culture, and the significant challenges they face due to environmental changes. The need for sustainable solutions that honor these personal and cultural narratives is absolutely crucial. \\n\\nYour insights on the flooding of the Nile Delta are invaluable and will greatly contribute to my article. Thank you for your help!\\nAI: You're welcome! I'm glad I could provide insights for your article on such a critical topic. The experiences of individuals and communities in the Nile Delta truly reflect the broader challenges posed by climate change. If you have any more questions or need further information in the future, feel free to reach out. Good luck with your writing!\\nAI: Thank you! I appreciate your willingness to help. I'm sure your insights will enrich the conversation around the impacts of climate change on communities and ecosystems. Have a great day, Dr. Rashid!\\nAI: Thank you!

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'run_id': 'ac7e876a-91e2-4e97-9a14-90096474a8c5', 'name': 'search_web', 'tags': ['graph:step:61'], 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 61, 'langgraph_node': 'search_web', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:search_web',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'search_web'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'search_web:11c093ea-6732-85b4-fa68-589b789a13ca'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78']}\n",

The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam.

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 326, 'prompt_tokens': 6146, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFOCRKQ4isZYdgPPc2hyFqvmqc9', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--4a9951bb-9b6c-4adf-9d56-f74def63e809-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6146, 'output_tokens': 326, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='44632768-1090-40bc-a7f0-45663ca1e5ef'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's correct!

This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 308, 'prompt_tokens': 9115, 'total_tokens': 9423, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 5248}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFsn6puewdlVdGJYdZLHWjx6kHj', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--a5699970-dd64-466e-ad40-c3d076126fdd-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 9115, 'output_tokens': 308, 'total_tokens': 9423, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 5248}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5016b844-c041-4d5c-ab00-0c2c457f8b7b'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's right!

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models.

Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places.

As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes. Many unresolved questions concerning the AHP remain: its beginning, cause, in\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe sea level has been rising from the end of the last ice age, which was around 20,000 years ago. Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region.

For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing.

Perhaps an individual or community that has been profoundly impacted by these events? This could provide a compelling narrative for my article.\\nAI: Yes, absolutely! One poignant case is that of a farmer named Saeed Umaira from Kafr El-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. His family has been cultivating crops in the region for generations. However, in recent years, the increasing salinity of the soil has dramatically affected his land's productivity. The saltwater intrusion due to rising sea levels has resulted in more than 80% of his farmland becoming unviable for traditional crops such as rice and vegetables [1].\\n\\nSaeed recounts how his family has adapted by shifting to more salt-tolerant crops, but the yields are significantly lower compared to what they once harvested. This economic strain has not only challenged his family's livelihood but has also disrupted the cultural practices around farming that have been a source of pride for his community. \\n\\nMoreover, he describes the emotional toll of witnessing the decline of his ancestral land, which is intertwined with his family's identity and heritage. The community's traditional agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest have become less frequent as the challenges surrounding food production intensify [2]. \\n\\nSaeed's story highlights the broader narrative of resilience and adaptation among local communities facing the ramifications of climate change and flooding. It underscores the necessity for holistic responses that incorporate local knowledge and practices into broader climate policies that affect their lives and traditions.\\n\\nSuch personal accounts offer a deeper understanding of how environmental changes affect people on an individual level, showcasing the pressing need for sustainable solutions within community contexts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] Earth Journalism Network article \\n[2] Climate Centre report\\nAI: Thank you so much for sharing that powerful story, Dr. Rashid.

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'run_id': '1d8ea3f6-121c-4b67-9392-3001b4871db9', 'name': 'search_wikipedia', 'tags': ['graph:step:61'], 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 61, 'langgraph_node': 'search_wikipedia', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:search_wikipedia',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'search_wikipedia'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'search_wikipedia:91fad88f-acce-616d-b7bb-e2e638097261'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78']}\n",

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models. Coastal cities, like Alexandria, are also facing same problem. It is said that every\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485524004249\"/>\\nCoastal areas in Egypt are under pressure and threat due to natural impacts, such as wave, current, tide, storm surges, and sediment supply as well as human interventions in the form of construction of seawalls, breakwaters, groins, and jetties as well as tourism development (ElKotby et al.,2023). Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places.

This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020). As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam.

In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl.

Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role.

Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE.

Concerned about conservation and its implications for local communities and ecosystems.'), 'interview': \"Human: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Hello, Dr. Rashid! My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid. It's surprising to hear that not only are we seeing rising sea levels, but also this phenomenon of land sinking creating compounded effects in such a densely populated area. \\n\\nCould you elaborate more on the cultural implications of these flooding events for the communities living in the Nile Delta? For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's correct! I'm delving into the complex interplay between the environmental changes occurring in the Nile Delta and their far-reaching impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how cultural practices, traditional livelihoods, and identity are adapting—or struggling to adapt—to the ongoing flooding and its causes. \\n\\nI'm intrigued by how this environmental crisis can disrupt not just the physical landscape, but the very fabric of community life. I would love to delve deeper into the role of local governance and community engagement in addressing these challenges. How are local communities responding to the flood risks? Are there any community-led initiatives or government policies that aim to mitigate the impacts? Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's right! I'm exploring the causes and consequences of the Nile Delta flooding in 2023, focusing on the environmental and cultural impacts on local communities. I'm particularly interested in how these floods are reshaping traditions, livelihoods, and identities in the region.\\n\\nBefore we wrap up, could you share a specific case study or personal story from your research that illustrates the human experience of flooding in the Nile Delta? Perhaps an individual or community that has been profoundly impacted by these events? This could provide a compelling narrative for my article.\\nAI: Yes, absolutely! One poignant case is that of a farmer named Saeed Umaira from Kafr El-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. His family has been cultivating crops in the region for generations. However, in recent years, the increasing salinity of the soil has dramatically affected his land's productivity. The saltwater intrusion due to rising sea levels has resulted in more than 80% of his farmland becoming unviable for traditional crops such as rice and vegetables [1].\\n\\nSaeed recounts how his family has adapted by shifting to more salt-tolerant crops, but the yields are significantly lower compared to what they once harvested. This economic strain has not only challenged his family's livelihood but has also disrupted the cultural practices around farming that have been a source of pride for his community. \\n\\nMoreover, he describes the emotional toll of witnessing the decline of his ancestral land, which is intertwined with his family's identity and heritage. The community's traditional agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest have become less frequent as the challenges surrounding food production intensify [2]. \\n\\nSaeed's story highlights the broader narrative of resilience and adaptation among local communities facing the ramifications of climate change and flooding. It underscores the necessity for holistic responses that incorporate local knowledge and practices into broader climate policies that affect their lives and traditions.\\n\\nSuch personal accounts offer a deeper understanding of how environmental changes affect people on an individual level, showcasing the pressing need for sustainable solutions within community contexts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] Earth Journalism Network article \\n[2] Climate Centre report\\nAI: Thank you so much for sharing that powerful story, Dr. Rashid. It certainly highlights the deep, personal connections individuals have with their land and culture, and the significant challenges they face due to environmental changes. The need for sustainable solutions that honor these personal and cultural narratives is absolutely crucial. \\n\\nYour insights on the flooding of the Nile Delta are invaluable and will greatly contribute to my article. Thank you for your help!\\nAI: You're welcome! I'm glad I could provide insights for your article on such a critical topic. The experiences of individuals and communities in the Nile Delta truly reflect the broader challenges posed by climate change.

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'name': 'answer_question', 'tags': ['graph:step:62'], 'run_id': 'ddc9197c-1e0f-4006-be5a-c5907af84367', 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 62, 'langgraph_node': 'answer_question', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:answer_question',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'answer_question'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'answer_question:3b2d8504-a597-34e6-3f2f-07b65ff86402'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78']}\n",

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models. Coastal cities, like Alexandria, are also facing same problem. It is said that every\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485524004249\"/>\\\\nCoastal areas in Egypt are under pressure and threat due to natural impacts, such as wave, current, tide, storm surges, and sediment supply as well as human interventions in the form of construction of seawalls, breakwaters, groins, and jetties as well as tourism development (ElKotby et al.,2023). Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\\\\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\\\\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\\\u200a746\\\\u200a\\\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\\\u200a727\\\\u200a \\\\n\\\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\\\\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses. Climate change is known to increase the frequency and severity of heatwaves, and to make precipitation less predictable a\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\\\n\\\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\\\n\\\\nEgypt\\\\\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\\\\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Agriculture ===\\\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\\\\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\\\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.climatecentre.org/wp-content/uploads/RCCC-Country-profiles-Egypt_2024_final.pdf\"/>\\\\nErosion The Nile Delta and its Mediterranean coast are highly exposed to changes in coastline caused by accretion and erosion, linked to sea level rise and storm surges. This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020). As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\\\nOf the world\\\\\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Etymology ==\\\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\\\\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\\\\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\\\\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8\"/>\\\\nexample, under the CCSM4 model, the peak flow for the first event (1998–2003) increased from 7002 m 3/s in 1998 to 8600 m 3/s (RCP 4.5) and 9400 m 3/s (RCP 8.5) in 2003 (Fig.[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8#Fig6)a,b, and Supplementary Fig.[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8#MOESM1)b).

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\\\nOf the world\\\\\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Etymology ==\\\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\\\\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\\\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Terminology ==\\\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\\\n\\\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\\\\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\\\\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\\\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\\\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Etymology ==\\\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Definitions ==\\\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Historical ===\\\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\\\\\'indigenous people(s)\\\\\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\\\\\'peoples\\\\\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\\\\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Recent ===\\\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== United Nations ====\\\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period.

People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara.

Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s.

Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\\\u200a1216\\\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\\\u200a1216\\\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\\\u200a5,\\\\u200a8\\\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\\\u200a1576\\\\u200a\\\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\\\u200a1302\\\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\\\u200a21\\\\u200a\\\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\\\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\\\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Observations ==\\\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\\\u200a1216\\\\u200a\\\\nW\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\\\\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\\\\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\\\n\\\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\\\n\\\\nEgypt\\\\\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\\\\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Agriculture ===\\\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\\\\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\\\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\\\\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\\\u200a746\\\\u200a\\\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\\\u200a727\\\\u200a \\\\n\\\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\\\\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

It aims at improving circular migration as an adaptation strategy at the local scale.\\\\n\\\\nMethods\\\\n------- [...] Since the early 2000s, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified the Nile Delta as one of the parts of the world most vulnerable to climate change impacts, including sea-level rise and rising temperatures.[[1]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration#_edn1) The climate crisis is compounding an already difficult situation in the delta: Egypt is experiencing sustained demographic growth, gaining 1\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nA wetland is a distinct semi-aquatic ecosystem whose groundcovers are flooded or saturated in water, either permanently, for years or decades, or only seasonally.  Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\\\\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\\\\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\\\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\\\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Research history ==\\\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\\\\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\\\nOf the world\\\\\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Etymology ==\\\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\\\\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\\\u2009\\\\\\'the mouths of the front parts\\\\\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\\\\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Courses ==\\\\n\\\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\\\\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\\\\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\\\n</Document>\\']\\n\\nWhen answering questions, follow these guidelines:\\n\\n1.

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models. Coastal cities, like Alexandria, are also facing same problem. It is said that every\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485524004249\"/>\\\\nCoastal areas in Egypt are under pressure and threat due to natural impacts, such as wave, current, tide, storm surges, and sediment supply as well as human interventions in the form of construction of seawalls, breakwaters, groins, and jetties as well as tourism development (ElKotby et al.,2023). Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\\\\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\\\\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\\\u200a746\\\\u200a\\\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\\\u200a727\\\\u200a \\\\n\\\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\\\\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses. Climate change is known to increase the frequency and severity of heatwaves, and to make precipitation less predictable a\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\\\n\\\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\\\n\\\\nEgypt\\\\\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\\\\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Agriculture ===\\\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\\\\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\\\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.climatecentre.org/wp-content/uploads/RCCC-Country-profiles-Egypt_2024_final.pdf\"/>\\\\nErosion The Nile Delta and its Mediterranean coast are highly exposed to changes in coastline caused by accretion and erosion, linked to sea level rise and storm surges. This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020). As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Etymology ==\\\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\\\\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\\\u2009\\\\\\'the mouths of the front parts\\\\\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\\\\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\".

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\\\\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\\\\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\\\\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\\\u2009\\\\\\'the mouths of the front parts\\\\\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\\\\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Courses ==\\\\n\\\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\\\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Terminology ==\\\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\\\n\\\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\\\\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\\\\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\\\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\\\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Etymology ==\\\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Definitions ==\\\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Historical ===\\\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\\\\\'indigenous people(s)\\\\\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\\\\\'peoples\\\\\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\\\\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Recent ===\\\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== United Nations ====\\\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Research history ==\\\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\\\\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes. Many unresolved questions concerning the AHP remain: its beginning, cause, in\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThe sea level has been rising from the end of the last ice age, which was around 20,000 years ago. Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\\\u200a1216\\\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\\\u200a1216\\\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\\\u200a5,\\\\u200a8\\\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\\\u200a1576\\\\u200a\\\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\\\u200a1302\\\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\\\u200a21\\\\u200a\\\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\\\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\\\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Observations ==\\\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\\\u200a1216\\\\u200a\\\\nW\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\\\\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\\\\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Research history ==\\\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature.

Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\\\\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\\\n\\\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\\\n\\\\nEgypt\\\\\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\\\\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Agriculture ===\\\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\\\\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\\\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\\\\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\\\u200a746\\\\u200a\\\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\\\u200a727\\\\u200a \\\\n\\\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\\\\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\\\\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\\\\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\\\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\\\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\\\nOf the world\\\\\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Etymology ==\\\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\\\\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\\\u2009\\\\\\'the mouths of the front parts\\\\\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\\\\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Courses ==\\\\n\\\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\\\\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\\\\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\\\n</Document>\\']\\n\\nWhen answering questions, follow these guidelines:\\n\\n1.

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 326, 'prompt_tokens': 6146, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFOCRKQ4isZYdgPPc2hyFqvmqc9', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--4a9951bb-9b6c-4adf-9d56-f74def63e809-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6146, 'output_tokens': 326, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='44632768-1090-40bc-a7f0-45663ca1e5ef'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's correct!

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river.

On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places.

The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role.

Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>'], 'analyst': Analyst(affiliation='National Geographic Society', name='Dr. Amina Rashid', role='Environmental Scientist and Cultural Anthropologist', description='Focused on environmental impacts and the cultural significance of the Nile Delta flooding.

My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

I'm delving into the complex interplay between the environmental changes occurring in the Nile Delta and their far-reaching impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how cultural practices, traditional livelihoods, and identity are adapting—or struggling to adapt—to the ongoing flooding and its causes. \\n\\nI'm intrigued by how this environmental crisis can disrupt not just the physical landscape, but the very fabric of community life.

Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face.

I'm particularly interested in how these floods are reshaping traditions, livelihoods, and identities in the region.\\n\\nBefore we wrap up, could you share a specific case study or personal story from your research that illustrates the human experience of flooding in the Nile Delta? Perhaps an individual or community that has been profoundly impacted by these events? This could provide a compelling narrative for my article.\\nAI: Yes, absolutely! One poignant case is that of a farmer named Saeed Umaira from Kafr El-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. His family has been cultivating crops in the region for generations. However, in recent years, the increasing salinity of the soil has dramatically affected his land's productivity. The saltwater intrusion due to rising sea levels has resulted in more than 80% of his farmland becoming unviable for traditional crops such as rice and vegetables [1].\\n\\nSaeed recounts how his family has adapted by shifting to more salt-tolerant crops, but the yields are significantly lower compared to what they once harvested. This economic strain has not only challenged his family's livelihood but has also disrupted the cultural practices around farming that have been a source of pride for his community. \\n\\nMoreover, he describes the emotional toll of witnessing the decline of his ancestral land, which is intertwined with his family's identity and heritage. The community's traditional agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest have become less frequent as the challenges surrounding food production intensify [2]. \\n\\nSaeed's story highlights the broader narrative of resilience and adaptation among local communities facing the ramifications of climate change and flooding. It underscores the necessity for holistic responses that incorporate local knowledge and practices into broader climate policies that affect their lives and traditions.\\n\\nSuch personal accounts offer a deeper understanding of how environmental changes affect people on an individual level, showcasing the pressing need for sustainable solutions within community contexts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] Earth Journalism Network article \\n[2] Climate Centre report\\nAI: Thank you so much for sharing that powerful story, Dr. Rashid.

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'name': 'route_messages', 'tags': ['seq:step:3'], 'run_id': '5559f29d-c681-4a75-9884-85e1245f3241', 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 62, 'langgraph_node': 'answer_question', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:answer_question',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'answer_question'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'answer_question:3b2d8504-a597-34e6-3f2f-07b65ff86402'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78', 'ddc9197c-1e0f-4006-be5a-c5907af84367']}\n",

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming .

Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.climatecentre.org/wp-content/uploads/RCCC-Country-profiles-Egypt_2024_final.pdf\"/>\\nErosion The Nile Delta and its Mediterranean coast are highly exposed to changes in coastline caused by accretion and erosion, linked to sea level rise and storm surges. This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020). As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016).

High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role.

Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025.

At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees.

There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

Concerned about conservation and its implications for local communities and ecosystems.'), 'interview': \"Human: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Hello, Dr. Rashid! My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid. It's surprising to hear that not only are we seeing rising sea levels, but also this phenomenon of land sinking creating compounded effects in such a densely populated area. \\n\\nCould you elaborate more on the cultural implications of these flooding events for the communities living in the Nile Delta? For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources.

Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country.

I'm particularly interested in how these floods are reshaping traditions, livelihoods, and identities in the region.\\n\\nBefore we wrap up, could you share a specific case study or personal story from your research that illustrates the human experience of flooding in the Nile Delta? Perhaps an individual or community that has been profoundly impacted by these events? This could provide a compelling narrative for my article.\\nAI: Yes, absolutely! One poignant case is that of a farmer named Saeed Umaira from Kafr El-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. His family has been cultivating crops in the region for generations. However, in recent years, the increasing salinity of the soil has dramatically affected his land's productivity. The saltwater intrusion due to rising sea levels has resulted in more than 80% of his farmland becoming unviable for traditional crops such as rice and vegetables [1].\\n\\nSaeed recounts how his family has adapted by shifting to more salt-tolerant crops, but the yields are significantly lower compared to what they once harvested. This economic strain has not only challenged his family's livelihood but has also disrupted the cultural practices around farming that have been a source of pride for his community. \\n\\nMoreover, he describes the emotional toll of witnessing the decline of his ancestral land, which is intertwined with his family's identity and heritage. The community's traditional agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest have become less frequent as the challenges surrounding food production intensify [2]. \\n\\nSaeed's story highlights the broader narrative of resilience and adaptation among local communities facing the ramifications of climate change and flooding. It underscores the necessity for holistic responses that incorporate local knowledge and practices into broader climate policies that affect their lives and traditions.\\n\\nSuch personal accounts offer a deeper understanding of how environmental changes affect people on an individual level, showcasing the pressing need for sustainable solutions within community contexts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] Earth Journalism Network article \\n[2] Climate Centre report\\nAI: Thank you so much for sharing that powerful story, Dr. Rashid.

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'run_id': '5559f29d-c681-4a75-9884-85e1245f3241', 'name': 'route_messages', 'tags': ['seq:step:3'], 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 62, 'langgraph_node': 'answer_question', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:answer_question',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'answer_question'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'answer_question:3b2d8504-a597-34e6-3f2f-07b65ff86402'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78', 'ddc9197c-1e0f-4006-be5a-c5907af84367']}\n",

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models. Coastal cities, like Alexandria, are also facing same problem. It is said that every\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485524004249\"/>\\nCoastal areas in Egypt are under pressure and threat due to natural impacts, such as wave, current, tide, storm surges, and sediment supply as well as human interventions in the form of construction of seawalls, breakwaters, groins, and jetties as well as tourism development (ElKotby et al.,2023). Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places.

This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020). As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam.

In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl.

Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role.

Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE.

My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid. It's surprising to hear that not only are we seeing rising sea levels, but also this phenomenon of land sinking creating compounded effects in such a densely populated area. \\n\\nCould you elaborate more on the cultural implications of these flooding events for the communities living in the Nile Delta? For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's correct! I'm delving into the complex interplay between the environmental changes occurring in the Nile Delta and their far-reaching impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how cultural practices, traditional livelihoods, and identity are adapting—or struggling to adapt—to the ongoing flooding and its causes. \\n\\nI'm intrigued by how this environmental crisis can disrupt not just the physical landscape, but the very fabric of community life. I would love to delve deeper into the role of local governance and community engagement in addressing these challenges. How are local communities responding to the flood risks? Are there any community-led initiatives or government policies that aim to mitigate the impacts? Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's right!

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'run_id': 'ddc9197c-1e0f-4006-be5a-c5907af84367', 'name': 'answer_question', 'tags': ['graph:step:62'], 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 62, 'langgraph_node': 'answer_question', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:answer_question',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'answer_question'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'answer_question:3b2d8504-a597-34e6-3f2f-07b65ff86402'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78']}\n",

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models. Coastal cities, like Alexandria, are also facing same problem.

Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.climatecentre.org/wp-content/uploads/RCCC-Country-profiles-Egypt_2024_final.pdf\"/>\\nErosion The Nile Delta and its Mediterranean coast are highly exposed to changes in coastline caused by accretion and erosion, linked to sea level rise and storm surges. This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020). As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8\"/>\\nexample, under the CCSM4 model, the peak flow for the first event (1998–2003) increased from 7002 m 3/s in 1998 to 8600 m 3/s (RCP 4.5) and 9400 m 3/s (RCP 8.5) in 2003 (Fig.[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8#Fig6)a,b, and Supplementary Fig.[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8#MOESM1)b).

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found.

Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>'], 'analyst': Analyst(affiliation='National Geographic Society', name='Dr. Amina Rashid', role='Environmental Scientist and Cultural Anthropologist', description='Focused on environmental impacts and the cultural significance of the Nile Delta flooding. Concerned about conservation and its implications for local communities and ecosystems.'), 'interview': \"Human: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Hello, Dr. Rashid! My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid. It's surprising to hear that not only are we seeing rising sea levels, but also this phenomenon of land sinking creating compounded effects in such a densely populated area. \\n\\nCould you elaborate more on the cultural implications of these flooding events for the communities living in the Nile Delta? For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life.

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'name': 'save_interview', 'tags': ['graph:step:63'], 'run_id': '0232755d-692a-4472-b1c5-3d16f727b2bb', 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 63, 'langgraph_node': 'save_interview', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:save_interview',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'save_interview'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'save_interview:a0891ba5-d5f2-31e1-1d95-8dac0f99210d'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78']}\n",

My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid. It's surprising to hear that not only are we seeing rising sea levels, but also this phenomenon of land sinking creating compounded effects in such a densely populated area. \\n\\nCould you elaborate more on the cultural implications of these flooding events for the communities living in the Nile Delta? For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically.

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 326, 'prompt_tokens': 6146, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFOCRKQ4isZYdgPPc2hyFqvmqc9', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--4a9951bb-9b6c-4adf-9d56-f74def63e809-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6146, 'output_tokens': 326, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='44632768-1090-40bc-a7f0-45663ca1e5ef'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's correct!

This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 308, 'prompt_tokens': 9115, 'total_tokens': 9423, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 5248}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFsn6puewdlVdGJYdZLHWjx6kHj', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--a5699970-dd64-466e-ad40-c3d076126fdd-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 9115, 'output_tokens': 308, 'total_tokens': 9423, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 5248}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5016b844-c041-4d5c-ab00-0c2c457f8b7b'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's right!

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models.

Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places.

As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes. Many unresolved questions concerning the AHP remain: its beginning, cause, in\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe sea level has been rising from the end of the last ice age, which was around 20,000 years ago. Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>'], 'analyst': Analyst(affiliation='National Geographic Society', name='Dr. Amina Rashid', role='Environmental Scientist and Cultural Anthropologist', description='Focused on environmental impacts and the cultural significance of the Nile Delta flooding. Concerned about conservation and its implications for local communities and ecosystems.'), 'interview': \"Human: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Hello, Dr. Rashid! My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid. It's surprising to hear that not only are we seeing rising sea levels, but also this phenomenon of land sinking creating compounded effects in such a densely populated area. \\n\\nCould you elaborate more on the cultural implications of these flooding events for the communities living in the Nile Delta? For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's correct! I'm delving into the complex interplay between the environmental changes occurring in the Nile Delta and their far-reaching impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how cultural practices, traditional livelihoods, and identity are adapting—or struggling to adapt—to the ongoing flooding and its causes. \\n\\nI'm intrigued by how this environmental crisis can disrupt not just the physical landscape, but the very fabric of community life. I would love to delve deeper into the role of local governance and community engagement in addressing these challenges. How are local communities responding to the flood risks? Are there any community-led initiatives or government policies that aim to mitigate the impacts? Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's right! I'm exploring the causes and consequences of the Nile Delta flooding in 2023, focusing on the environmental and cultural impacts on local communities. I'm particularly interested in how these floods are reshaping traditions, livelihoods, and identities in the region.\\n\\nBefore we wrap up, could you share a specific case study or personal story from your research that illustrates the human experience of flooding in the Nile Delta? Perhaps an individual or community that has been profoundly impacted by these events? This could provide a compelling narrative for my article.\\nAI: Yes, absolutely! One poignant case is that of a farmer named Saeed Umaira from Kafr El-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. His family has been cultivating crops in the region for generations. However, in recent years, the increasing salinity of the soil has dramatically affected his land's productivity. The saltwater intrusion due to rising sea levels has resulted in more than 80% of his farmland becoming unviable for traditional crops such as rice and vegetables [1].\\n\\nSaeed recounts how his family has adapted by shifting to more salt-tolerant crops, but the yields are significantly lower compared to what they once harvested. This economic strain has not only challenged his family's livelihood but has also disrupted the cultural practices around farming that have been a source of pride for his community. \\n\\nMoreover, he describes the emotional toll of witnessing the decline of his ancestral land, which is intertwined with his family's identity and heritage. The community's traditional agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest have become less frequent as the challenges surrounding food production intensify [2]. \\n\\nSaeed's story highlights the broader narrative of resilience and adaptation among local communities facing the ramifications of climate change and flooding. It underscores the necessity for holistic responses that incorporate local knowledge and practices into broader climate policies that affect their lives and traditions.\\n\\nSuch personal accounts offer a deeper understanding of how environmental changes affect people on an individual level, showcasing the pressing need for sustainable solutions within community contexts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] Earth Journalism Network article \\n[2] Climate Centre report\\nAI: Thank you so much for sharing that powerful story, Dr. Rashid. It certainly highlights the deep, personal connections individuals have with their land and culture, and the significant challenges they face due to environmental changes. The need for sustainable solutions that honor these personal and cultural narratives is absolutely crucial. \\n\\nYour insights on the flooding of the Nile Delta are invaluable and will greatly contribute to my article.

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'run_id': '0232755d-692a-4472-b1c5-3d16f727b2bb', 'name': 'save_interview', 'tags': ['graph:step:63'], 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 63, 'langgraph_node': 'save_interview', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:save_interview',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'save_interview'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'save_interview:a0891ba5-d5f2-31e1-1d95-8dac0f99210d'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78']}\n",

The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 326, 'prompt_tokens': 6146, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFOCRKQ4isZYdgPPc2hyFqvmqc9', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--4a9951bb-9b6c-4adf-9d56-f74def63e809-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6146, 'output_tokens': 326, 'total_tokens': 6472, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='44632768-1090-40bc-a7f0-45663ca1e5ef'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's correct!

This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 308, 'prompt_tokens': 9115, 'total_tokens': 9423, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 5248}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloFsn6puewdlVdGJYdZLHWjx6kHj', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--a5699970-dd64-466e-ad40-c3d076126fdd-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 9115, 'output_tokens': 308, 'total_tokens': 9423, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 5248}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='5016b844-c041-4d5c-ab00-0c2c457f8b7b'), AIMessage(content=\"Yes, that's right!

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models.

Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places.

As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes. Many unresolved questions concerning the AHP remain: its beginning, cause, in\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe sea level has been rising from the end of the last ice age, which was around 20,000 years ago. Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>'], 'analyst': Analyst(affiliation='National Geographic Society', name='Dr. Amina Rashid', role='Environmental Scientist and Cultural Anthropologist', description='Focused on environmental impacts and the cultural significance of the Nile Delta flooding. Concerned about conservation and its implications for local communities and ecosystems.'), 'interview': \"Human: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Hello, Dr. Rashid! My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid. It's surprising to hear that not only are we seeing rising sea levels, but also this phenomenon of land sinking creating compounded effects in such a densely populated area. \\n\\nCould you elaborate more on the cultural implications of these flooding events for the communities living in the Nile Delta? For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's correct! I'm delving into the complex interplay between the environmental changes occurring in the Nile Delta and their far-reaching impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how cultural practices, traditional livelihoods, and identity are adapting—or struggling to adapt—to the ongoing flooding and its causes. \\n\\nI'm intrigued by how this environmental crisis can disrupt not just the physical landscape, but the very fabric of community life. I would love to delve deeper into the role of local governance and community engagement in addressing these challenges. How are local communities responding to the flood risks? Are there any community-led initiatives or government policies that aim to mitigate the impacts? Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's right! I'm exploring the causes and consequences of the Nile Delta flooding in 2023, focusing on the environmental and cultural impacts on local communities. I'm particularly interested in how these floods are reshaping traditions, livelihoods, and identities in the region.\\n\\nBefore we wrap up, could you share a specific case study or personal story from your research that illustrates the human experience of flooding in the Nile Delta? Perhaps an individual or community that has been profoundly impacted by these events? This could provide a compelling narrative for my article.\\nAI: Yes, absolutely! One poignant case is that of a farmer named Saeed Umaira from Kafr El-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. His family has been cultivating crops in the region for generations. However, in recent years, the increasing salinity of the soil has dramatically affected his land's productivity. The saltwater intrusion due to rising sea levels has resulted in more than 80% of his farmland becoming unviable for traditional crops such as rice and vegetables [1].\\n\\nSaeed recounts how his family has adapted by shifting to more salt-tolerant crops, but the yields are significantly lower compared to what they once harvested. This economic strain has not only challenged his family's livelihood but has also disrupted the cultural practices around farming that have been a source of pride for his community. \\n\\nMoreover, he describes the emotional toll of witnessing the decline of his ancestral land, which is intertwined with his family's identity and heritage. The community's traditional agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest have become less frequent as the challenges surrounding food production intensify [2]. \\n\\nSaeed's story highlights the broader narrative of resilience and adaptation among local communities facing the ramifications of climate change and flooding. It underscores the necessity for holistic responses that incorporate local knowledge and practices into broader climate policies that affect their lives and traditions.\\n\\nSuch personal accounts offer a deeper understanding of how environmental changes affect people on an individual level, showcasing the pressing need for sustainable solutions within community contexts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] Earth Journalism Network article \\n[2] Climate Centre report\\nAI: Thank you so much for sharing that powerful story, Dr. Rashid. It certainly highlights the deep, personal connections individuals have with their land and culture, and the significant challenges they face due to environmental changes. The need for sustainable solutions that honor these personal and cultural narratives is absolutely crucial. \\n\\nYour insights on the flooding of the Nile Delta are invaluable and will greatly contribute to my article. Thank you for your help!\\nAI: You're welcome! I'm glad I could provide insights for your article on such a critical topic. The experiences of individuals and communities in the Nile Delta truly reflect the broader challenges posed by climate change.

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'name': 'write_section', 'tags': ['graph:step:64'], 'run_id': '1e4c0c2d-b784-4885-9c8d-91eea975103f', 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 64, 'langgraph_node': 'write_section', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:write_section',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'write_section'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'write_section:cd21c470-1ad2-cf43-31ab-a94cd827f5c9'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78']}\n",

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models. Coastal cities, like Alexandria, are also facing same problem. It is said that every\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485524004249\"/>\\\\nCoastal areas in Egypt are under pressure and threat due to natural impacts, such as wave, current, tide, storm surges, and sediment supply as well as human interventions in the form of construction of seawalls, breakwaters, groins, and jetties as well as tourism development (ElKotby et al.,2023). Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\\\\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\\\\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\\\u200a746\\\\u200a\\\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\\\u200a727\\\\u200a \\\\n\\\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\\\\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses. Climate change is known to increase the frequency and severity of heatwaves, and to make precipitation less predictable a\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\\\n\\\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\\\n\\\\nEgypt\\\\\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\\\\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Agriculture ===\\\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\\\\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\\\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.climatecentre.org/wp-content/uploads/RCCC-Country-profiles-Egypt_2024_final.pdf\"/>\\\\nErosion The Nile Delta and its Mediterranean coast are highly exposed to changes in coastline caused by accretion and erosion, linked to sea level rise and storm surges. This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020). As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\\\\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\\\\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\\\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Terminology ==\\\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\\\n\\\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\\\\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\\\\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\\\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\\\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Etymology ==\\\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Definitions ==\\\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Historical ===\\\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\\\\\'indigenous people(s)\\\\\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\\\\\'peoples\\\\\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\\\\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Recent ===\\\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== United Nations ====\\\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Research history ==\\\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\\\\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes. Many unresolved questions concerning the AHP remain: its beginning, cause, in\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThe sea level has been rising from the end of the last ice age, which was around 20,000 years ago. Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\\\u200a1216\\\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\\\u200a1216\\\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\\\u200a5,\\\\u200a8\\\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\\\u200a1576\\\\u200a\\\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\\\u200a1302\\\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\\\u200a21\\\\u200a\\\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\\\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\\\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Observations ==\\\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\\\u200a1216\\\\u200a\\\\nW\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\\\\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\\\\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Research history ==\\\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature.

Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\\\n\\\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\\\n\\\\nEgypt\\\\\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\\\\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Agriculture ===\\\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\\\\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\\\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\\\\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\\\u200a746\\\\u200a\\\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\\\u200a727\\\\u200a \\\\n\\\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\\\\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\\\\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\\\\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\\\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\\\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\\\nOf the world\\\\\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Etymology ==\\\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\\\\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\\\u2009\\\\\\'the mouths of the front parts\\\\\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\\\\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Courses ==\\\\n\\\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\\\\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\\\\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\\\n</Document>\\']', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]]}}, 'name': 'ChatOpenAI', 'tags': ['seq:step:1'], 'run_id': 'bd12ffeb-1a61-4446-b6e4-db28cca74568', 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 64, 'langgraph_node': 'write_section', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:write_section',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'write_section'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'write_section:cd21c470-1ad2-cf43-31ab-a94cd827f5c9', 'checkpoint_ns': 'write_section:cd21c470-1ad2-cf43-31ab-a94cd827f5c9', 'ls_provider': 'openai', 'ls_model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'ls_model_type': 'chat', 'ls_temperature': None}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78', '1e4c0c2d-b784-4885-9c8d-91eea975103f']}\n",

As one of the world's most vulnerable regions to rising sea levels, approximately 2,660 km² (about 25% of the northern Delta) may be submerged by 2100 due to global warming and local subsidence [1][2]. Alexandria, situated at the Delta’s western edge, is predicted to see devastating impacts, including saltwater intrusion into groundwater, which compromises local agriculture—a sector critical for food security and livelihoods [3][4].\\n\\nInterestingly, communities are adapting to these changes by embracing local knowledge and migration strategies, thereby fostering resilience amid these challenges. Interviews with farmers and fishermen reveal an increasing reliance on circular migration as a method to maintain economic stability and food sources while managing environmental risks [5]. This strategy not only serves as a temporary solution for families displaced by flooding but also enhances adaptive capacity within the local economy [6]. However, economic challenges such as inflation complicate these efforts, revealing an urgent need for systemic support to foster sustainable adaptability among vulnerable communities [7].\\n\\nMoreover, the agricultural shifts necessitate increased irrigation efficiency and a transition towards less water-intensive crops to ensure long-term resilience [8]. The balancing act between environmental stewardship and cultural preservation is crucial, as local customs deeply tied to the Nile perpetuate community identity. Existing resilience projects initiated by UNDP and other organizations aim to enhance coastal management through ecosystem-based strategies that empower local populations and protect critical resources from flooding and salinity [9][10].\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\\\\\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\\\\\n[3] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485524004249  \\\\\\n[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture  \\\\\\n[5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt  \\\\\\n[6] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\\\\\n[7] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\\\\\n[8] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\\\\\n[9] https://bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\\\\\n[10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile \", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ded0d14823'}, id='run--bd12ffeb-1a61-4446-b6e4-db28cca74568', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 24599, 'output_tokens': 609, 'total_tokens': 25208, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 20736}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), 'input': {'messages': [[SystemMessage(content='You are an expert technical writer. \\n\\nYour task is to create a short, easily digestible section of a report based on a set of source documents.\\n\\n1.

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models. Coastal cities, like Alexandria, are also facing same problem. It is said that every\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485524004249\"/>\\\\nCoastal areas in Egypt are under pressure and threat due to natural impacts, such as wave, current, tide, storm surges, and sediment supply as well as human interventions in the form of construction of seawalls, breakwaters, groins, and jetties as well as tourism development (ElKotby et al.,2023). Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\\\\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\\\\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\\\u200a746\\\\u200a\\\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\\\u200a727\\\\u200a \\\\n\\\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\\\\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses. Climate change is known to increase the frequency and severity of heatwaves, and to make precipitation less predictable a\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\\\n\\\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\\\n\\\\nEgypt\\\\\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\\\\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Agriculture ===\\\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\\\\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\\\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.climatecentre.org/wp-content/uploads/RCCC-Country-profiles-Egypt_2024_final.pdf\"/>\\\\nErosion The Nile Delta and its Mediterranean coast are highly exposed to changes in coastline caused by accretion and erosion, linked to sea level rise and storm surges.

As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016).

High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Etymology ==\\\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\\\\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\\\u2009\\\\\\'the mouths of the front parts\\\\\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\\\\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\\\\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\\\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Terminology ==\\\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\\\n\\\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\\\\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\\\\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\\\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\\\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Etymology ==\\\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Definitions ==\\\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Historical ===\\\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\\\\\'indigenous people(s)\\\\\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\\\\\'peoples\\\\\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\\\\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Recent ===\\\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== United Nations ====\\\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Research history ==\\\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\\\\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role.

Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\\\u200a1216\\\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\\\u200a1216\\\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\\\u200a5,\\\\u200a8\\\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\\\u200a1576\\\\u200a\\\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\\\u200a1302\\\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\\\u200a21\\\\u200a\\\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\\\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\\\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Observations ==\\\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\\\u200a1216\\\\u200a\\\\nW\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\\\\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\\\\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

[...] alarming considering that between 11.75percent and 15.56 percent of the entire belt of the Nile Delta may be inundated by the year 2100 because of land subsidence alone—that is, even without accounting for sea level rise or other effects of climate change.12\\\\n</Document>\\', \\'<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nClimate change is causing Egypt’s already hot and arid climate to experience environmental stresses including extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea level rise. As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\\\n\\\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\\\n\\\\nEgypt\\\\\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\\\\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Agriculture ===\\\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\\\\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\\\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\\\\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\\\u200a746\\\\u200a\\\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\\\u200a727\\\\u200a \\\\n\\\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\\\u200a717\\\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\\\\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\\\\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\\\\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\\\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\\\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\\\\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Research history ==\\\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\\\\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Etymology ==\\\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\\\\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\\\u2009\\\\\\'the mouths of the front parts\\\\\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\\\\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Courses ==\\\\n\\\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\\\\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\\\\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\\\n</Document>\\']', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]]}}, 'run_id': 'bd12ffeb-1a61-4446-b6e4-db28cca74568', 'name': 'ChatOpenAI', 'tags': ['seq:step:1'], 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 64, 'langgraph_node': 'write_section', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:write_section',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'write_section'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'write_section:cd21c470-1ad2-cf43-31ab-a94cd827f5c9', 'checkpoint_ns': 'write_section:cd21c470-1ad2-cf43-31ab-a94cd827f5c9', 'ls_provider': 'openai', 'ls_model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'ls_model_type': 'chat', 'ls_temperature': None}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78', '1e4c0c2d-b784-4885-9c8d-91eea975103f']}\n",

The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 2919, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BloF8BXfoBCtvKIl8wSeIRfmHQBg3', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--aa30b4e6-2e87-42e3-a36f-a83f644c89bf-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2919, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 3225, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), AIMessage(content=\"That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse.

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models. Coastal cities, like Alexandria, are also facing same problem. It is said that every\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485524004249\"/>\\nCoastal areas in Egypt are under pressure and threat due to natural impacts, such as wave, current, tide, storm surges, and sediment supply as well as human interventions in the form of construction of seawalls, breakwaters, groins, and jetties as well as tourism development (ElKotby et al.,2023). Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places.

This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020).

The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion.

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\".

Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found.

Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role.

Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>'], 'analyst': Analyst(affiliation='National Geographic Society', name='Dr. Amina Rashid', role='Environmental Scientist and Cultural Anthropologist', description='Focused on environmental impacts and the cultural significance of the Nile Delta flooding.

The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid.

For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse.

I'm delving into the complex interplay between the environmental changes occurring in the Nile Delta and their far-reaching impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how cultural practices, traditional livelihoods, and identity are adapting—or struggling to adapt—to the ongoing flooding and its causes. \\n\\nI'm intrigued by how this environmental crisis can disrupt not just the physical landscape, but the very fabric of community life.

Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face.

Situated at the confluence of the world's longest river and the Mediterranean Sea, this region has nourished Egyptian civilization for millennia. However, projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that by 2100, approximately 2,660 km², or 25% of the Delta, could be submerged due to ongoing sea-level rise, exacerbated by land subsidence and other anthropogenic pressures[1][2]. This alarming forecast not only threatens the intricate web of biodiversity in the Delta's wetlands but also poses serious challenges to the agricultural practices that sustain millions of inhabitants.\\n\\nOne of the most striking insights from recent analyses is how local communities are already beginning to feel the repercussions of these environmental changes. Farmers and fishermen are experiencing reduced yields and altered seasons, prompting urgent adaptations. Interviews conducted with stakeholders from various sectors reveal that the challenges extend beyond environmental degradation—they include socio-economic strains, such as inflation and resource scarcity[3][4]. Migration trends are evolving as families may look to urban centers for new economic opportunities, further complicating community dynamics[5]. As sea levels rise, saltwater intrusion is compromising freshwater sources, destroying arable land, and compelling many to abandon their ancestral homes. The cultural significance of the Delta is intertwined with its agricultural productivity and ecological health, making the intersection of climate change with community resilience a crucial area of focus.\\n\\nDespite these formidable challenges, progressive adaptation strategies are being promoted. Local initiatives seek to protect coastal infrastructures and bolster community resilience. International support from organizations such as the UNDP is focusing on sustainable management approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations in the Delta region[6][7]. The future of the Nile Delta depends not only on tackling these environmental threats but also on integrating cultural considerations into conservation practices. \\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\n[3] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\n[4] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\n[5] https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp053  \\n[6] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\n[7] https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/10/climate-change-in-egypt-opportunities-and-obstacles?lang=en  \"]}}, 'run_id': '1e4c0c2d-b784-4885-9c8d-91eea975103f', 'name': 'write_section', 'tags': ['graph:step:64'], 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1', 'langgraph_step': 64, 'langgraph_node': 'write_section', 'langgraph_triggers': ('branch:to:write_section',), 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'write_section'), 'langgraph_checkpoint_ns': 'write_section:cd21c470-1ad2-cf43-31ab-a94cd827f5c9'}, 'parent_ids': ['c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78']}\n",

Alexandria and the Nile Delta are among the most vulnerable areas in the world to climate change.1 The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and causing saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. It would also cause buildings to collapse and [...] salination of farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and triggering internal displacement.2 Reports suggest that even 50cm of sea-level rise would threaten 2 million people in Alexandria, including Al Max.3 Increased temperatures driven by climate change are already affecting biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Al Max lies in a low-lying coastal enclave with some sections looking over the Mediterranean Sea and others along a canal that cuts through the area, linking the sea with nearby Lake Mariout. In addition to the risk of sea-level rise, Alexandria and the surrounding Nile Delta is sinking at roughly the same rate due, in part, to “upstream dams that prevent the replenishment of silt and to natural gas extraction.”9 These factors are predicted to exacerbate the effects of sea level rise with\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt\"/>\\nAccording to a recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Nile Delta is increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels which is an implication of global warming . The report also highlights that approximately 2,660 km2 in the northern Delta are projected to be submerged by the year 2100. This comprises about 25% of the Delta as stated by mathematical models. Coastal cities, like Alexandria, are also facing same problem.

Furthermore, climate change (CC) effects are also threatening these areas, because of their high human densities, diversified ecosystems, ongoing urbanization, and intense industrial activities [...] The Nile Delta in Egypt is particularly susceptible to the detrimental consequences of coastal zone degradation caused by CC and SLR, as evidenced by various studies in the literature. These effects vary in intensity across different afflicted areas. The main goal of this study is to perform a coastal vulnerability analysis for the Nile Delta in Egypt using two distinct approaches: Gornitz\\'s method and AHP model, in light of the identified research gaps, which are as follows: (1) the dearth of [...] (Elshinnawy and Almaliki, 2021, Hemida et al., 2023). One of the most certain and alarming impacts of CC is sea-level rise (SLR), which will intensify the pressure on many coastal regions (Ehsan et al., 2019). Human activities have caused a sharp increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere globally, which has led to significant losses of ice mass and the trapping of heat emitted from land in the atmosphere and ocean (IPCC, 2007). According to the very high GHG emissions\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.climatecentre.org/wp-content/uploads/RCCC-Country-profiles-Egypt_2024_final.pdf\"/>\\nErosion The Nile Delta and its Mediterranean coast are highly exposed to changes in coastline caused by accretion and erosion, linked to sea level rise and storm surges. This, in turn, puts exposed communities and infrastructure at risk of flooding and saline intrusions (Torresan et al., 2020). As sea levels are projected to rise significantly, and ongoing urban development along the coastline increases exposure to storm surges, the risks of flooding and saline intrusions are expected to [...] Some scenarios project that a 0.5m rise in sea level by 2050 could displace 2–4 million Egyptians and increase the out-migration of people from coastal zones to other parts of the country (TNC, 2016). Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, sits on the Nile River Delta and is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels (MMC, 2023). High numbers of people in the densely populated Lower Nile Delta are projected to have to migrate due to rising sea levels and related negative [...] implications including pollution, coastal erosion, flooding and the salination of agricultural land (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2019; Bonnefoi, 2024). The majority of these communities have limited capacity to migrate due to lack of resources, and there is a substantial lack of awareness that the changing environment is caused by climate change, thus resources are often directed to short-term fixes rather than invested into long-term resilience (Bonnefoi, 2024; Kassem et al.,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost\"/>\\nHowever, today the situation has changed.

The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8\"/>\\nexample, under the CCSM4 model, the peak flow for the first event (1998–2003) increased from 7002 m 3/s in 1998 to 8600 m 3/s (RCP 4.5) and 9400 m 3/s (RCP 8.5) in 2003 (Fig.[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8#Fig6)a,b, and Supplementary Fig.[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77002-8#MOESM1)b).

Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. Flood management methods can be either of the structural type (i.e. flood control) and of the non-structural type. Structural methods hold back floodwaters physically, while non-structural methods do not. Building hard infrastructure to prevent flooding, such as flood walls, is effective at managing flooding. However, it is best practice within landscape engineering to rely more on soft infrastructure and natural systems, such as marshes and flood plains, for handling the increase in water.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. Flood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. \\nAs climate change has led to increased flood risk an intensity, flood management is an important part of climate change adaptation and climate resilience. For example, to prevent or manage coastal flooding, coastal management practices have to handle natural processes like tides but also sea level rise due to climate change. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nFlood management is a broad term that includes measures to control or mitigate flood waters, such as actions to prevent floods from occurring or to minimize their impacts when they do occur.\\nFlood management methods can be structural or non-structural:\\n\\nStructural flood management (i.e.: flood control) is the reduction of the effects of a flood using physical solutions, such as reservoirs, levees, dredging and diversions.\\nNon-structural flood management includes land-use planning, advanced warning systems and flood insurance. Further examples are: \"zoning ordinances and codes, flood forecasting, flood proofing, evacuation and channel clearing, flood fight activities, and upstream land treatment or management to control flood damages without physically restraining flood waters\".\\nThere are several related terms that are closely connected or encompassed by flood management.\\nFlood management can include flood risk management, which focuses on measures to reduce risk, vulnerability and exposure to flood disasters and providing risk analysis through, for example, flood risk assessment. In the context of natural hazards and disasters, risk management involves \"plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks\".\\nFlood control, flood protection, flood defence and flood alleviation are all terms that mean \"the detention and/or diversion of water during flood events for the purpose of reducing discharge or downstream inundation\". Flood control is part of environmental engineering. It involves the management of water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of floodwalls and flood gates to prevent floodwaters from reaching a particular area.\\nFlood mitigation is a related but separate concept describing a broader set of strategies taken to reduce flood risk and potential impact while improving resilience against flood events. These methods include prevention, prediction (which enables flood warnings and evacuation), proofing (e.g.: zoning regulations), physical control (nature-based solutions and physical structures like dams and flood walls) and insurance (e.g.: flood insurance policies).\\nFlood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels during a flooding event.

Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIndigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin indigena is based on the Old Latin indu \"in, within\" + gignere \"to beget, produce\". Indu is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or \"in\".\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical ===\\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"\\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time \\'indigenous people(s)\\' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural \\'peoples\\' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World\\'s Indigenous Peoples.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent ===\\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\\n\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\nNo definition of Indigenous pe\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role.

Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\\u200a1216\\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\\u200a5,\\u200a8\\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\\u200a1576\\u200a\\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth\\'s temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. The reported factors of increase in flood hazard potential are often exceedingly large, ranging from 10 to 1000 for even modest sea-level rise scenarios of 0.5\\u2009m or less. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) to 130 cm (4+1⁄2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 50 cm (1.6 ft) or even by 1.9 m (6.2 ft) by 2100.:\\u200a1302\\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19–22 metres (62–72 ft) if warming peaks at 5 °C (9.0 °F).:\\u200a21\\u200a\\nRising seas affect every coastal population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and increased vulnerability to tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \\nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands including atolls. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \\nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \\n\\n\\n== Observations ==\\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013–2022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\\u200a1216\\u200a\\nW\\n</Document>', '<Document href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\"/>\\nThe findings and argument of this brief are based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Egyptian Arabic with farmers, fishermen, and city dwellers in several areas of the Nile Delta between February 2021 and June 2023.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today.

As a highly vulnerable nation to climate change, these extreme conditions will have significant impacts on the lives of Egyptians due to resulting food insecurity, water scarcity, health and economic impacts.\\n\\nEgypt has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, as well as submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which sets priority areas as sustainability of agriculture, water resources, the environment, energy, and land management.\\nEgypt is located on the northeast of the continent of Africa. The population was 102.3 million in 2020 and is projected to grow to 159.9 million by 2050. \\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\nDespite experiencing some of the most significant impacts of climate change, Egypt has not been a primary contributor of the greenhouse gasses that have caused climate change. Based on 2020 data Egypt accounts for only 0.63% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However Climate Trace estimates 2022 emissions at 440 million tonnes CO2eq, which is 0.75% of their estimated global total of 58.37 billion tonnes. \\n\\n\\n== Climate change impacts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\n\\nEgypt\\'s climate is hot, dry, and dominated by desert. Egypt has a hot summer from May to October and a mild winter from November to April. In the desert, summer temperatures can range from a high of 43°C (109°F) during the day to 7°C (45°F) at night and winter temperatures range from 18°C (64°F) to 0°C (32°F). The coast is more mild with temperatures ranging from a high of 30°C (86°F) in the winter to a low of 14°C (57°F)  in the winter.\\nFrom the years of 2000-2020, average temperature in Egypt increased by 0.38 degrees celsius per decade, a temperature increase that is higher than the world average. The projected future warming rates in the MENA region range between 0.2°C per decade and 0.5°C per decade. In addition, the magnitude and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. Extreme temperatures are expected to be especially prevalent in specific locations in Egypt, such as South Sinai and Aswan.\\nEgypt has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change but only 63rd for being most prepared for climate change. Egypt\\'s increase in average temperature over the past two decades has resulted in an increase in energy needs for cooling, which will only continue to increase with further warming in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures also contribute to increasing desertification, increased drying of the Nile River, decreasing precipitation, rising sea levels, and increasing flash floods.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nEven without the impacts of climate change, Egypt\\'s arid climate makes it vulnerable for water scarcity and food scarcity. Most of Egypt does not receive much rain, thus all of its agricultural production is around the Nile River. The population of Egypt is increasing, therefore the country will require more food and water. Agriculture is important to the Egyptian economy, making up 11.3% of the GDP and providing 28% of jobs. However, climate change is creating challenges for the agricultural sector. One concern is decreasing crop production. Due to heat stress, water stress, and salinity, food crop yields are projected to decline by 10% by 2050. The crops with the largest yield declines are expected to be maize, oilseeds, sugarcrops and fruits and vegetables. \\nEgypt is dependent on global markets for wheat imports and food security. Egypt consumes 20.5 million tonnes of wheat a year, half of which is produced domestically with the remaining half supplied from imports. However, wheat yields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of climate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased pests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for imported food will i\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture\" page=\"\"/>\\nThere are numerous effects of climate change on agriculture, many of which are making it harder for agricultural activities to provide global food security. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns often result in lower crop yields due to water scarcity caused by drought, heat waves and flooding. These effects of climate change can also increase the risk of several regions suffering simultaneous crop failures. Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply. Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world\\'s livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues. These issues range from greater heat stress to animal feed shortfalls and the spread of parasites and vector-borne diseases.:\\u200a746\\u200a\\nThe increased atmospheric CO2 level from human activities (mainly burning of fossil fuels) causes a CO2 fertilization effect. This effect offsets a small portion of the detrimental effects of climate change on agriculture. However, it comes at the expense of lower levels of essential micronutrients in the crops.:\\u200a717\\u200a Furthermore, CO2 fertilization has little effect on C4 crops like maize. On the coasts, some agricultural land is expected to be lost to sea level rise, while melting glaciers could result in less irrigation water being available. On the other hand, more arable land may become available as frozen land thaws. Other effects include erosion and changes in soil fertility and the length of growing seasons. Bacteria like Salmonella and fungi that produce mycotoxins grow faster as the climate warms. Their growth has negative effects on food safety, food loss and prices.\\nExtensive research exists on the effects of climate change on individual crops, particularly on the four staple crops: corn (maize), rice, wheat and soybeans. These crops are responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed). The research investigates important uncertainties, for example future population growth, which will increase global food demand for the foreseeable future. The future degree of soil erosion and groundwater depletion are further uncertainties. On the other hand, a range of improvements to agricultural yields, collectively known as the Green Revolution, has increased yields per unit of land area by between 250% and 300% since 1960. Some of that progress will likely continue.:\\u200a727\\u200a \\n\\nGlobal food security will change relatively little in the near-term. 720 million to 811 million people were undernourished in 2021, with around 200,000 people being at a catastrophic level of food insecurity. Climate change is expected to add an additional 8 to 80 million people who are at risk of hunger by 2050. The estimated range depends on the intensity of future warming and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.:\\u200a717\\u200a Agricultural productivity growth will likely have improved food security for hundreds of millions of people by then. Predictions that reach further into the future (to 2100 and beyond) are rare. There is some concern about the effects on food security from more extreme weather events in future. Nevertheless, at this stage there is no expectation of a widespread global famine due to climate change within the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n== Direct effects from changing weather patterns ==\\n\\n\\n=== Observed changes in adverse weather conditions ===\\n \\n\\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather, and major events like heatwaves or droughts or heavy rains (also known as low and high precipitation extremes) can cause substantial losses. For example, Australia\\'s farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.

It aims at improving circular migration as an adaptation strategy at the local scale.\\n\\nMethods\\n------- [...] Since the early 2000s, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified the Nile Delta as one of the parts of the world most vulnerable to climate change impacts, including sea-level rise and rising temperatures.[[1]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration#_edn1) The climate crisis is compounding an already difficult situation in the delta: Egypt is experiencing sustained demographic growth, gaining 1\\n</Document>', '<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland\" page=\"\"/>\\nA wetland is a distinct semi-aquatic ecosystem whose groundcovers are flooded or saturated in water, either permanently, for years or decades, or only seasonally.  Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation\\'s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.\\nWetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, marshes are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. Swamps are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves and halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.\\nExamples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include tidal wetlands, where the water source is ocean tides; estuaries, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; floodplains, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and bogs and vernal ponds, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world\\'s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  \\nWetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. \\nHumans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect \"wetlands of international importance.\"  \\n\\n\\n== Definitions and terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Technical definitions ===\\nA simplified definition of wetland is \"an area of land that is usually saturated with water\". More precisely, wetlands are areas where \"water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season\". A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a \"wetland\", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enoug\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period\" page=\"\"/>\\nThe African humid period (AHP; also known by other names) was a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in the Earth\\'s axial tilt, changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon, and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, and its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600–14,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the Bølling–Allerød warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,000–5,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the end of the period appears to have taken place in several steps, such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies.\\n\\n\\n== Research history ==\\nHerodotus in 440 BC and Strabo in 23 AD discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher Heinrich Barth discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering petroglyphs in the Murzuq Desert, as did Ahmed Hassanein following his 1923 exploration of the Libyan Desert when he saw depictions of savanna animals at Gabal El Uweinat. Further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer László Almásy to coin the concept of a Green Sahara in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes and higher Nile flow levels was increasingly reported and it was recognized that the Holocene featured a humid period in the Sahara.\\nThe idea that changes in Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such orbital controls on climate was found. At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"pluvial hypothesis\") before radiocarbon dating became widespread. Beginning in the 1970s, the humidification was attributed to precessional changes.\\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with archaeology, climate modelling and paleoproxies. with archaeological sites, Deposits left by wind, vegetation (e.g leaf wax), lakes and wetlands, and archaeological sites also played an important role. Pollen, lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the African humid period, and charcoal and leaf impressions have been used to identify vegetation changes.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world,\\nthough this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.\\nOf the world\\'s major rivers, the Nile has one of the lowest average annual flow rates.\\nAbout 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.\\nIn particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.\\nIn these countries it is an important economic factor in agriculture and fishing.\\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, being the longer, is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream, while the Blue Nile actually contributes 80% of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\\nAfter Khartoum the river flows north, almost entirely through the Nubian Desert, to Cairo and its large delta, joining the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called Ḥꜥpy (Hapy) or Jtrw (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the-canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name. In Nobiin, the river is called Áman Dawū, meaning \"the great water\". In Luganda, the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro, it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called en-Nīl, while in Standard Arabic it is called an-Nīl. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Ye\\'or or הַשִׁיחוֹר\\u200e, Ha-Shiḥor.\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-Nîl and an-Nîl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος. Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed. Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, Aiguptos, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos; this term later became generalized for the entire river system. Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression nꜣ rꜣw-ḥꜣw(t) (lit.\\u2009\\'the mouths of the front parts\\'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced ni-lo-he in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE. Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the river gods, son of Oceanus and Tethys.\\nAnother derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: nila; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة), which refers to Indigofera tinctoria, one of the original sources of indigo dye. Another may be Nymphaea caerulea, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun\\'s corpse when it was excavated in 1922. Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal, meaning \"river\". Old Libyan has the term lilu, meaning water (in modern Berber ilel ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means sea).\\n\\n\\n== Courses ==\\n\\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth.

The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region. Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide. Sudan has been described as facing the world\\'s worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.\\nSince gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications.\\nFamine alone has killed an estimated 522,000 children, while the overall death toll of the war, including fatalities from violence, starvation, and disease, is even higher; thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres, primarily attributed to the RSF and allied militias. At least 61,000 people have died in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence. As of 5 February 2025, over 8.8 million were internally displaced and more than 3.5 million others had fled the country as refugees. In August 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed famine conditions in parts of North Darfur.\\nForeign involvement in Sudan\\'s conflict has included arms shipments from China, Russia and Turkey, with UAE and Chad support for the RSF and Egypt support for the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human right\\n</Document>'], 'analyst': Analyst(affiliation='National Geographic Society', name='Dr. Amina Rashid', role='Environmental Scientist and Cultural Anthropologist', description='Focused on environmental impacts and the cultural significance of the Nile Delta flooding. Concerned about conservation and its implications for local communities and ecosystems.'), 'interview': \"Human: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Hello, Dr. Rashid! My name is Samuel Turner, and I'm an environmental analyst with a keen interest in the interaction between ecosystems and local cultures. I'm fascinated by the flooding of the Nile Delta and its implications. \\n\\nYou mentioned that you are focusing on the causes and consequences of the 2023 flooding. Could you share a surprising insight about how climate change has altered the flooding patterns in the Nile Delta compared to previous decades? What specific evidence supports this shift?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding patterns in the Nile Delta have indeed been significantly altered by climate change. One of the most alarming insights is the combination of sea-level rise and land sinking, which exacerbates the flooding risks. The Nile Delta is projected to face very serious threats, with approximately 2,660 km² of the northern Delta expected to be submerged by the year 2100, which encompasses about 25% of the Delta area [2]. \\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that global sea levels could rise by as much as 68 cm by 2050, which, coupled with the rate of sinking in the Delta due to upstream dams and natural gas extraction, puts millions of people at risk [1]. Specifically, even a 50 cm rise could directly endanger around 2 million people in Alexandria [1] and contribute to saltwater intrusion in groundwater, ultimately threatening agricultural livelihoods in the surrounding areas [2].\\n\\nThe intensification of flooding is linked not only to increasing sea levels but also to increased temperatures that threaten biodiversity and the overall stability of ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. Coastal cities like Alexandria, with their high population density and diverse ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable [3]. \\n\\nThis interplay of factors is creating a more unpredictable and severe flooding dynamic in the Nile Delta, as evidenced by these thorough assessments from reputable climate studies and reports. \\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023 \\n[2] Space4Water document \\n[3] ScienceDirect article\\nAI: That's truly fascinating, Dr. Rashid. It's surprising to hear that not only are we seeing rising sea levels, but also this phenomenon of land sinking creating compounded effects in such a densely populated area. \\n\\nCould you elaborate more on the cultural implications of these flooding events for the communities living in the Nile Delta? For instance, how have traditions or day-to-day lifestyles been altered as a result of environmental changes? Are there any specific practices or cultural heritages that are at risk?\\nAI: Certainly! The flooding events in the Nile Delta are having significant cultural implications for the local communities that have long relied on the region's resources for their livelihoods, identity, and way of life. As agricultural lands and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and salinization, traditional farming practices are being altered dramatically. The salination of farmland due to saltwater intrusion can lead to decreased agricultural productivity, which is crucial for these communities [1]. The loss of crops not only impacts food security but also disrupts the cultural practices tied to agriculture, which is deeply embedded in the local way of life.\\n\\nMoreover, many fishermen and farmers are being forced to migrate due to the deteriorating conditions, leading to a loss of cultural heritage as these communities disperse. With internal displacement on the rise, the social fabric and cultural identities that have developed over generations in specific areas are being threatened [1][3]. \\n\\nThe reliance on the Nile River has historically shaped the communities’ cultural beliefs, resulting in rich traditions linked to the river. As flooding becomes more frequent and severe, the associated rituals and practices that celebrate their connection to the Nile might diminish. Without the possibility to pass down these traditions to future generations, invaluable aspects of their cultural heritage could be lost.\\n\\nThus, the environmental changes not only threaten livelihoods but also lead to the erosion of cultural identity tied closely to the land and its resources. These transformations necessitate urgent attention to ensure the resilience of both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's correct! I'm delving into the complex interplay between the environmental changes occurring in the Nile Delta and their far-reaching impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how cultural practices, traditional livelihoods, and identity are adapting—or struggling to adapt—to the ongoing flooding and its causes. \\n\\nI'm intrigued by how this environmental crisis can disrupt not just the physical landscape, but the very fabric of community life. I would love to delve deeper into the role of local governance and community engagement in addressing these challenges. How are local communities responding to the flood risks? Are there any community-led initiatives or government policies that aim to mitigate the impacts? Could you provide specific examples of such efforts?\\nAI: Local communities in the Nile Delta have begun to engage in various initiatives to mitigate the impacts of flooding and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. One important aspect has been the collaboration between community members and local governance to enhance resilience through sustainable practices and infrastructure improvements.\\n\\nFor example, initiatives such as the Haya Karima (A Decent Life) program, launched by the Egyptian government, aim to improve infrastructure and services in rural areas throughout the country. This includes the development of flood-resistant constructions, better drainage systems, and investments in resilient agricultural practices that can withstand salinization and flooding effects [2]. \\n\\nAdditionally, local communities are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental challenges they face. Some have taken steps to diversify their livelihoods beyond traditional agriculture and fishing. This diversification may include developing small-scale businesses or engaging in eco-tourism, leveraging local cultural heritage while also reducing reliance on vulnerable natural resources [3]. \\n\\nFurthermore, ethnographic fieldwork has shown that discussions among community members about the risks of flooding and climate change are gradually becoming more frequent. This increasing awareness can lead to better preparation for flood events, including community-wide responses such as improved communication systems and local emergency plans [2]. \\n\\nIn summary, while challenges remain significant, the local communities are slowly adapting to the realities of flooding, and there is a growing recognition of the need for collaboration with government initiatives to build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] ReliefWeb document, January 2023\\n[2] Baker Institute brief \\n[3] Climate Centre report\\nHuman: So you said you were writing an article on The Flooding of the Nile Delta in 2023: Causes and Consequences?\\nAI: Yes, that's right! I'm exploring the causes and consequences of the Nile Delta flooding in 2023, focusing on the environmental and cultural impacts on local communities. I'm particularly interested in how these floods are reshaping traditions, livelihoods, and identities in the region.\\n\\nBefore we wrap up, could you share a specific case study or personal story from your research that illustrates the human experience of flooding in the Nile Delta? Perhaps an individual or community that has been profoundly impacted by these events? This could provide a compelling narrative for my article.\\nAI: Yes, absolutely! One poignant case is that of a farmer named Saeed Umaira from Kafr El-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. His family has been cultivating crops in the region for generations. However, in recent years, the increasing salinity of the soil has dramatically affected his land's productivity. The saltwater intrusion due to rising sea levels has resulted in more than 80% of his farmland becoming unviable for traditional crops such as rice and vegetables [1].\\n\\nSaeed recounts how his family has adapted by shifting to more salt-tolerant crops, but the yields are significantly lower compared to what they once harvested. This economic strain has not only challenged his family's livelihood but has also disrupted the cultural practices around farming that have been a source of pride for his community. \\n\\nMoreover, he describes the emotional toll of witnessing the decline of his ancestral land, which is intertwined with his family's identity and heritage. The community's traditional agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest have become less frequent as the challenges surrounding food production intensify [2]. \\n\\nSaeed's story highlights the broader narrative of resilience and adaptation among local communities facing the ramifications of climate change and flooding. It underscores the necessity for holistic responses that incorporate local knowledge and practices into broader climate policies that affect their lives and traditions.\\n\\nSuch personal accounts offer a deeper understanding of how environmental changes affect people on an individual level, showcasing the pressing need for sustainable solutions within community contexts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] Earth Journalism Network article \\n[2] Climate Centre report\\nAI: Thank you so much for sharing that powerful story, Dr. Rashid. It certainly highlights the deep, personal connections individuals have with their land and culture, and the significant challenges they face due to environmental changes. The need for sustainable solutions that honor these personal and cultural narratives is absolutely crucial. \\n\\nYour insights on the flooding of the Nile Delta are invaluable and will greatly contribute to my article. Thank you for your help!\\nAI: You're welcome! I'm glad I could provide insights for your article on such a critical topic. The experiences of individuals and communities in the Nile Delta truly reflect the broader challenges posed by climate change. If you have any more questions or need further information in the future, feel free to reach out. Good luck with your writing!\\nAI: Thank you! I appreciate your willingness to help. I'm sure your insights will enrich the conversation around the impacts of climate change on communities and ecosystems. Have a great day, Dr. Rashid!\\nAI: Thank you!

As one of the world's most vulnerable regions to rising sea levels, approximately 2,660 km² (about 25% of the northern Delta) may be submerged by 2100 due to global warming and local subsidence [1][2]. Alexandria, situated at the Delta’s western edge, is predicted to see devastating impacts, including saltwater intrusion into groundwater, which compromises local agriculture—a sector critical for food security and livelihoods [3][4].\\n\\nInterestingly, communities are adapting to these changes by embracing local knowledge and migration strategies, thereby fostering resilience amid these challenges. Interviews with farmers and fishermen reveal an increasing reliance on circular migration as a method to maintain economic stability and food sources while managing environmental risks [5]. This strategy not only serves as a temporary solution for families displaced by flooding but also enhances adaptive capacity within the local economy [6]. However, economic challenges such as inflation complicate these efforts, revealing an urgent need for systemic support to foster sustainable adaptability among vulnerable communities [7].\\n\\nMoreover, the agricultural shifts necessitate increased irrigation efficiency and a transition towards less water-intensive crops to ensure long-term resilience [8]. The balancing act between environmental stewardship and cultural preservation is crucial, as local customs deeply tied to the Nile perpetuate community identity. Existing resilience projects initiated by UNDP and other organizations aim to enhance coastal management through ecosystem-based strategies that empower local populations and protect critical resources from flooding and salinity [9][10].\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max  \\\\\\n[2] https://space4water.org/local-perspectives-case-studies/sea-level-rise-and-potential-predictions-sinking-delta-egypt  \\\\\\n[3] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485524004249  \\\\\\n[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture  \\\\\\n[5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Egypt  \\\\\\n[6] https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\\\\\n[7] https://earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-2-can-the-country-reclaim-what-its-lost  \\\\\\n[8] https://www.adaptation-undp.org/resources/videos/protecting-communities-nile-delta-coastal-flooding  \\\\\\n[9] https://bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration  \\\\\\n[10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile \"]}}, 'run_id': 'c4d6e383-834c-4f1c-8223-cfc6cc948f78', 'name': 'Conduct Interviews', 'tags': [], 'metadata': {'thread_id': '1'}, 'parent_ids': []}\n"

      "## The Vulnerability of the Nile Delta: Environmental Impacts and Cultural Significance of Rising Flooding Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "The Nile Delta, an essential ecological and cultural region in Egypt, is facing increasingly severe threats from climate change, particularly from rising sea levels and related flooding risks. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that substantial portions of the Delta could be submerged by 2100, jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions who rely on its rich agricultural land and the Nile River for survival and income. Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city, exemplifies these vulnerabilities, as it sits on the brink of significant flooding and saltwater intrusion that threaten local freshwater supplies and agricultural viability [1][2].\n",
      "\n",
      "Reports indicate that as sea levels rise, combined with the ongoing land subsidence in the Delta due to upstream damming and natural gas extraction, up to 25% of the Delta may be submerged, impacting around 2 million residents in Alexandria alone [2][3]. This phenomenon not only threatens biodiversity but also strains traditional agricultural practices, with projections suggesting declines in crop yields of vital staples like maize and wheat of 10-20% by 2050 due to increased salinity and extreme weather events linked to climate change [4][5].\n",
      "\n",
      "Particularly concerning is the alarming increase in salinity levels in agricultural lands, which diminishes productivity and threatens food security [6]. The local cultural heritage tied to water management and agriculture may face erosion as climate impacts intensify, emphasizing the need for immediate adaptation strategies. Notably, some residents have already formulated adaptation measures, such as employing sand to improve soil conditions; however, these are often short-term solutions that require broader institutional support [5][7].\n",
      "\n",
      "The Delta's rich wetland ecosystems, which have historically supported local communities and diverse wildlife, are also under threat. As saltwater contamination spreads, specific species endemic to the region face existential risks, prompting concerns over the loss of not just economic resources, but also cultural identities linked to these natural environments [8].\n",

The combination of these physical changes, alongside climatic pressures like storm surges and extreme weather events, has created a precarious situation for local communities and ecosystems in the Nile Delta.\\n\\nThese factors illustrate the complex interplay between climate change, human activity, and regional vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable management practices to mitigate these impacts.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] reliefweb.int/report/egypt/climate-and-mobility-case-study-january-2023-alexandria-egypt-al-max\\n[2] earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-1-the-sea-engulfs-kafr-el-sheikh\\n[3] sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352485524004249', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 353, 'prompt_tokens': 3217, 'total_tokens': 3570, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BlbxQupc6PxJOuI03v0ZS5wxZKVSQ', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--20526b6b-b36b-40a5-bc12-a1bd85c045d4-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3217, 'output_tokens': 353, 'total_tokens': 3570, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}),\n",

As coastal flooding has increased, these fishermen have faced daunting challenges due to salination of freshwater sources and loss of fishing grounds, which were historically vital for their livelihoods [1].\\n\\nIn response to these environmental pressures, many in the community have begun to adapt through what can be understood as circular migration strategies. This involves individuals temporarily relocating to urban areas for work and sending remittances back home to support their families. This migration not only provides crucial financial resources but also opens up opportunities for acquiring new skills that can be utilized upon their return. However, these adaptations are often limited by economic pressures, such as rising inflation rates, which can hinder investments back into sustainable practices [2].\\n\\nInterestingly, this process has been a layered response interwoven with cultural resilience, where traditional fishing knowledge is combined with new methods learned in urban environments. Some residents are also experimenting with aquaculture to mitigate losses from overfishing and flooding or are participating in community initiatives focused on sustainable land and water management practices [3].\\n\\nThe interplay of migration and adaptation shows how deeply rooted cultural practices can inform responses to climate impacts, even as the context evolves due to environmental changes.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] earthjournalism.net/stories/egypts-nile-delta-under-threat-part-1-the-sea-engulfs-kafr-el-sheikh\\n[2] bakerinstitute.org/research/sea-level-rise-nile-delta-promoting-adaptation-through-circular-migration\\n[3] greenclimate.fund/project/fp053', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 332, 'prompt_tokens': 5676, 'total_tokens': 6008, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_57db37749c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BlbxfbrqE8c5mMuJ9Y4sgX6Io6YVw', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='expert', id='run--6eb6feb9-7c5e-4f6d-bd3b-e10d52cb6e72-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 5676, 'output_tokens': 332, 'total_tokens': 6008, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})],\n",
